WMU Computer Information Systems Capstone Project 
Fall 2017
Lucas Chacon

This Project was to create a web based application for viewing data saved on a mysql database.
In this instance we had data from a CIS 1020 class here at western. The data was iClicker data
that was stored as excel files. We preprocessed the data and formatted it into sql which was then 
loaded onto the mysql database using phpmyadmin on a xampp server. 

We created HTML web pages for SIGN IN, NEW USER, HOMEPAGE, STUDENT SECTION, QUESTION SECTION
In those HTML pages is a series of PHP scripts that process infomation that is entered in html
forms and drop downs
